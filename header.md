ow-rank
=======

Compare Overwatch competitive ranking levels with ranking systems of other games. Comparison is based on player distribution.

### Data taken from:
  * http://masteroverwatch.com/leaderboards/pc/global
  * http://www.leagueofgraphs.com/rankings/rank-distribution
  * https://csgosquad.com/ranks
  * https://yasp.co/distributions

Note that none of these sources provide totally correct data. They are based on a selection of tracked players which should be large enough to provide a decent approximation of the real distribution.

I'll try to update the ranking somewhat regularly.
